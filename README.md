# CS50x 2024 - Problem Sets & Exercises

Welcome to my CS50x GitHub repository! This repository contains all the problem sets, additional exercises, and projects that I've completed as part of the [CS50x 2024 course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) offered by Harvard University. This course provides a broad introduction to computer science and programming, covering topics such as algorithms, data structures, web development, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each corresponding to a specific problem set or project. Below is an overview of the structure:

```
### Problem Sets

Each problem set (`pset1`, `pset2`, etc.) contains multiple programming challenges that focus on different aspects of computer science. Each subdirectory within a problem set contains the following:

- **Source Code**: The `.c` files or other relevant code that solve the problems.

### Additional Exercises

The `additional_exercises/` directory contains any extra challenges or exercises I've worked on outside of the standard problem sets. These are designed to further reinforce the concepts learned during the course.

### Final Project

The `final_project/` directory contains the source code and documentation for my final project. This project is a culmination of all the skills learned throughout the course and represents a more significant and creative challenge.

## Usage

To run any of the code in this repository, you'll need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. If you're using the CS50 IDE, you can compile and run the code directly from there. For example:

```bash
cd pset1/hello
make hello
./hello
```

### Requirements
- CS50 IDE or a local C development environment (GCC recommended)
- Basic knowledge of C programming and command-line operations
