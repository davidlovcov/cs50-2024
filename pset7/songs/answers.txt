1. Q: If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

       SELECT AVG(energy) as "average energy",
              AVG(valence) as "average valence",
              AVG(danceability) as "average danceability"
       FROM songs;

    A:  By running the code above we get following results:

        average energy: 0.65906
        average valence: 0.484443
        average danceability: 0.71646

        With those results we can say that the user loves songs,
        that lead to dancing and have a lot of energy.
        The user prefers both positive and negative songs almost evenly.


2. Q: Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
      What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

    A: The analysis counts only for the year 2018 and doesn't include other dates.
       A listeners mood can vary by time.
       To get a safe bet on what the listeners Song Aura really is you have to make a long-time analysis.
